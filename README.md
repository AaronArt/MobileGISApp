# Mobile GIS App

## Overview

This project is a mobile GIS application built with Expo and React Native. The app allows users to find and navigate to nearby touristic places using Google Maps. Users can play a game by visiting these places and answering questions to gain points. Upon visiting all places and answering all questions correctly, the app displays a congratulatory message and allows the user to restart the game.

## Features

- Location-based services to find the nearest touristic places.
- Integration with Google Maps to show routes and locations.
- A game where users answer questions at each location to gain points.
- Persistent state to track visited places and answered questions.
- A restart feature to play the game again.
